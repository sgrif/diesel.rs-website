Getting started!

Diesel is a Safe, Extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust.

Diesel is the most productive way to interact with databases in Rust because of its safe and composable abstractions over queries.

Running the server:
```sh
bundle exec middleman
```

Master branch is automatically deployed to Github Pages.
