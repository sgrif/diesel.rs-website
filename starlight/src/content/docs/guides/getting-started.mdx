For this guide, we're going to walk through some simple examples for each of the pieces of CRUD,
which stands for "Create Read Update Delete". Each step in this guide will build on the previous
and is meant to be followed along.

Before we start, make sure you have one of PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MySQL installed and running. In the project repository, you may find various [examples](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.3.x/examples) for every supported database.

:::note[A note on Rust versions:]
  Diesel requires Rust 1.86.0 or later. If you're following along with this guide, make sure you're using at least that version of Rust by running `rustup update stable`.

## Initializing a new project

The first thing we need to do is generate our project.

```sh title="Generate a new project"
cargo new --lib diesel_demo
cd diesel_demo
```

First, let's add Diesel to our dependencies. We're also going to use a tool called
[`.env`][dotenvy] to manage our environment variables for us. We'll add it to our dependencies
as well.

## Choosing your Database

<Tabs syncKey="db-backend">
  <TabItem label="PostgreSQL">
    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    diesel = { version = "2.2.0", features = ["postgres"] }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="SQLite">
    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    diesel = { version = "2.2.0", features = ["sqlite"] }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MySQL">
    ```toml title="Cargo.toml"
    diesel = { version = "2.2.0", features = ["mysql"] }
