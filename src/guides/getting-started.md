For this guide, we're going to walk through some simple examples for each of the pieces of CRUD,
which stands for "Create Read Update Delete". Each step in this guide will build on the previous
and is meant to be followed along.

Before we start, make sure you have one of PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MySQL installed and running. In the project repository, you may find various [examples](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples) for every supported database. 

<aside class = "aside aside--note">
<header class = "aside__header">A note on Rust versions:</header>

::: aside__text
Diesel requires Rust 1.78 or later. If you're following along with this guide,
make sure you're using at least that version of Rust by running `rustup update stable`.

## Initializing a new project

The first thing we need to do is generate our project.

::: code-block

[Generate a new project]()

```sh
cargo new --lib diesel_demo
cd diesel_demo
```

:::

First, let's add Diesel to our dependencies. We're also going to use a tool called
[`.env`][dotenvy] to manage our environment variables for us. We'll add it to our dependencies
as well.

## Installing Diesel CLI

Diesel provides a separate [CLI] tool to help manage your project. Since it's a standalone binary,
and doesn't affect your project's code directly, we don't add it to `Cargo.toml`.
Instead, we just install it on our system.

[CLI]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/diesel_cli

We provide pre-built binaries for diesel cli. You can install the command line tool via:

:::code-block

[Install the CLI tool]()

```sh
# Linux/MacOS
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/releases/latest/download/diesel_cli-installer.sh | sh

# Windows (powershell)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
irm https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/releases/latest/download/diesel_cli-installer.ps1 | iex
```

:::

You also can use [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) for this. To install diesel cli with `cargo binstall` run the following command:

::: code-block

[Install with cargo binstall]()

```sh
cargo binstall diesel_cli
```
:::

This automatically finds the right binary for your system.

Alternatively you can manually install diesel cli by using `cargo install:`

::: code-block

[Install the CLI tool]()

```sh
cargo install diesel_cli
```
:::

<aside class = "aside aside--note">
<header class = "aside__header"> A note on installing `diesel_cli`</header>

::: aside__text

If you run into an error like:

```
note: ld: library not found for -lmysqlclient
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

This means you are missing the client library needed for a database backend
– `mysqlclient` in this case. You can resolve this issue by either installing the library
(using the usual way to do this depending on your operating system) or by excluding
the undesired default library with the `--no-default-features` flag. 

By default diesel CLI depends on the following client libraries:

* [`libpq`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) for the PostgreSQL backend
* [`libmysqlclient`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-implementations.html) for the Mysql backend
* [`libsqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for the SQLite backend

If you are not sure on how to install those dependencies please consult the documentation of the corresponding dependency or your distribution package manager. By default diesel will dynamically link these libraries, which means they need to be present on your system at build and runtime.

::: postgres-example
For example, if you only have PostgreSQL installed, you can use this to install `diesel_cli`
with only PostgreSQL:

```sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```
:::
::: sqlite-example
For example, if you only have SQLite installed, you can use this to install `diesel_cli`
with only SQLite:

```sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```
:::
::: mysql-example
For example, if you only have MySQL installed, you can use this to install `diesel_cli`
with only MySQL:

```sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features mysql
```
:::

If you are unsure how to configure these dependencies checkout [diesel CI](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L63-L222) configuration for a working setup for different operating systems.

Diesel-cli also offers features to build and statically link these libraries during `cargo install`. Use the `postgres-bundled`, `mysql-bundled` and `sqlite-bundled` feature flags for this. You need to provide the build dependencies for these libraries in that case. This involves a C compiler for all of them and for mysql cmake + a C++ compiler. In turn it might simplify your setup process.

There are no `*-bundled` features for diesel itself. If you want to utilise static linking there as well you need to add a dependency on the relevant sys crate (`pq-sy` for PostgreSQL, `mysqlclient-sys` for MySQL and `libsqlite3-sys` for SQLite) and enable the `bundled` feature for this crate. See the uncommented lines in the example `Cargo.toml` files above for the corresponding setup.
:::
</aside>

## Setup Diesel for your project

We need to tell Diesel where to find our database. We do this by setting the `DATABASE_URL`
environment variable. On our development machines, we'll likely have multiple projects going,
and we don't want to pollute our environment. We can put the url in a `.env` file instead.

::: postgres-example
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/diesel_demo > .env
```
:::

::: sqlite-example
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=/path/to/your/sqlite/database.db > .env
```
:::

::: mysql-example
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost/diesel_demo > .env
```
:::

Now Diesel CLI can set everything up for us.

```
diesel setup
```

This will create our database (if it didn't already exist) and set up the initial migrations directory, which will contain a generated migration file that establishes the Diesel setup. Note that the migrations directory will not be empty as the initial setup migration is automatically generated.

Now we're going to write a small CLI that lets us manage a blog (ignoring the fact
that we can only access the database from this CLI…). The first thing we're going to need is
a table to store our posts. Let's create a migration for that:

```sh
diesel migration generate create_posts
```

Diesel CLI will create two empty files for us in the required structure.
You'll see output that looks something like this:

```
Creating migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/up.sql
Creating migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/down.sql
```

Migrations allow us to evolve the database schema over time. Each migration consists of an `up.sql` file to apply the changes and a `down.sql` file to revert them. Applying and immediately reverting a migration should leave your database schema unchanged.

Next, we'll write the SQL for migrations:

::: postgres-example
::: code-block

[up.sql (PostgreSQL)]( https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/up.sql)

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
)
```

:::
:::

::: sqlite-example
::: code-block

[up.sql (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20170124012402_create_posts/up.sql)

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
)
```

:::
:::

::: mysql-example
::: code-block

[up.sql (MySQL)]( https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/up.sql)

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

:::
:::


::: postgres-example
::: code-block

[down.sql (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/down.sql)

```sql
DROP TABLE posts
```

:::
:::

::: sqlite-example
::: code-block

[down.sql (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20170124012402_create_posts/down.sql)

```sql
DROP TABLE posts
```

:::
:::

::: mysql-example
::: code-block

[down.sql (MySQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/migrations/20160815133237_create_posts/down.sql)

```sql
DROP TABLE posts
```

:::
:::

We can apply our new migration:

```sh
diesel migration run
```

It's a good idea to ensure that `down.sql` is correct. You can quickly confirm that your `down.sql`
rolls back your migration correctly by `redoing` the migration:

```
diesel migration redo
```

<aside class = "aside aside--note">
<header class = "aside__header"> A Note on Raw SQL in Migrations:</header>
::: aside__text
Since migrations are written in raw SQL, they can contain specific features of the database system you use.
For example, the `CREATE TABLE` statement above uses PostgreSQL's `SERIAL` type. If you want to use SQLite instead,
you need to use `INTEGER` instead. The [diesel GitHub repository](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/examples) 
contains modified examples for all supported backends. Be sure to select the backend you are using at the top of the page to see examples specific for that backend.

If you prefer to generate your migrations based on Rust code instead, the diesel CLI tool provides an additional `--diff-schema`  on the `diesel migration generate` command that allows to generate migrations based on the current schema definition and your database. To generate a migration equivalent to the shown Raw SQL migration you need to 

* Create a `schema.rs` file with the following content:

::: postgres-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)
```rust
diesel::table! {
    posts (id) {
        id -> Int4,
        title -> Varchar,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::
::: sqlite-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)
```rust
diesel::table! {
    posts (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        title -> Text,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::
::: mysql-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (MySQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)
```rust
diesel::table! {
    posts (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        title -> Varchar,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::

[The documentation of the `table!` macro](https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/macro.table.html) contains the syntax used for this macros. [The `diesel::sql_types` module](https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/sql_types/index.html) provides documentation for the SQL side types used to define the relevant columns.

* Run `diesel migration generate --diff-schema create_posts`

This will generate both the `up.sql` and the `down.sql` files of your migration pre-populated with the relevant SQL. After that, you should continue with the `diesel migration run` step.

::: aside__text
When preparing your app for use in production, you may want to run your migrations
during the application's initialization phase. You may also want to include the migration scripts
as a part of your code, to avoid having to copy them to your deployment location/image etc.

The [diesel_migrations] crate provides the [`embed_migrations!`] macro, allowing you to embed migration scripts
in the final binary. Once your code uses it, you can simply include `connection.run_pending_migrations(MIGRATIONS)`
at the start of your `main` function to run migrations every time the application starts.

## Write Rust

OK enough SQL, let's write some Rust. We'll start by writing some code to show the last five published posts.
The first thing we need to do is establish a database connection.

::: postgres-example
::: code-block

[src/lib.rs (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/src/lib.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;
use dotenvy::dotenv;
use std::env;

pub fn establish_connection() -> PgConnection {
    dotenv().ok();

    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    PgConnection::establish(&database_url)
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!("Error connecting to {}", database_url))
}
```

:::
:::
::: sqlite-example
::: code-block

[src/lib.rs (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/src/lib.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;
use dotenvy::dotenv;
use std::env;

pub fn establish_connection() -> SqliteConnection {
    dotenv().ok();

    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    SqliteConnection::establish(&database_url)
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!("Error connecting to {}", database_url))
}
```

:::
:::
::: mysql-example
::: code-block

[src/lib.rs (MySQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/src/lib.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;
use dotenvy::dotenv;
use std::env;

pub fn establish_connection() -> MysqlConnection {
    dotenv().ok();

    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    MysqlConnection::establish(&database_url)
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!("Error connecting to {}", database_url))
}
```

:::
:::

We'll also want to create a `Post` struct into which we can read our data, and have diesel generate the names
we'll use to reference tables and columns in our queries.

We'll add the following lines to the top of `src/lib.rs`:

::: {.shared-example backends="postgres, sqlite, mysql"}
::: code-block

[src/lib.rs](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/$backend/getting_started_step_1/src/lib.rs#L1-L2)

```rust
pub mod models;
pub mod schema;
```
:::
:::

Next we need to create the two modules that we just declared.

::: postgres-example
::: code-block

[src/models.rs (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/src/models.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;

#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]
#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::posts)]
#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::pg::Pg))]
pub struct Post {
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub body: String,
    pub published: bool,
}
```

:::
:::

::: sqlite-example
::: code-block

[src/models.rs (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/src/models.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;

#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]
#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::posts)]
#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::sqlite::Sqlite))]
pub struct Post {
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub body: String,
    pub published: bool,
}
```

:::
:::
::: mysql-example
::: code-block

[src/models.rs (MySQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/src/models.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;

#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]
#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::posts)]
#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::mysql::Mysql))]
pub struct Post {
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub body: String,
    pub published: bool,
}
```

:::
:::

[`#[derive(Queryable)]`] will generate all of the code needed to load a `Post` struct from a SQL query. 
[`#[derive(Selectable)]`] will generate code to construct a matching select clause based on your model type based on the 
table defined via `#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::posts)]`. 
`#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::pg::Pg))` (or `sqlite::SQLite` or `mysql::MySQL`) adds additional compile time checks to verify that all field types in 
your struct are compatible with their corresponding SQL side expressions. This part is optional, but it greatly improves
the generated compiler error messages.

[`#[derive(Queryable)]`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/prelude/derive.Queryable.html
[`#[derive(Selectable)]`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/prelude/derive.Selectable.html

Typically the schema module isn't created by hand, it gets generated by diesel CLI. When we ran `diesel setup`,
a file called [diesel.toml] was created which tells Diesel to maintain a file at `src/schema.rs` for us.
The file should look like this:

[diesel.toml]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/diesel.toml

::: postgres-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)
```rust
diesel::table! {
    posts (id) {
        id -> Int4,
        title -> Varchar,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::
::: sqlite-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (SQLite)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)
```rust
diesel::table! {
    posts (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        title -> Text,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::
::: mysql-example
::: code-block
[schema.rs (MySQL)](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1/src/schema.rs)

        id -> Integer,
        title -> Varchar,
        body -> Text,
        published -> Bool,
    }
}
```
:::
:::

The exact output might vary slightly depending on your database, but it should be equivalent.

The [`table!` macro] creates a bunch of code based on the database schema to represent
all of the tables and columns. We'll see how exactly to use that in the next example.
For a deep dive into the generated code see the [Schema in Depth](schema-in-depth.html) guide.

Any time we run or revert a migration, this file will get automatically updated.

<aside class = "aside aside--note">
<header class = "aside__header"> A Note on Field Order</header>

::: aside__text

Using `#[derive(Queryable)]` assumes that the order of fields on the `Post` struct matches
the columns in the `posts` table, so make sure to define them in the order seen in the `schema.rs` file.
Using `#[derive(Selectable)]` in combination with [`SelectableHelper::as_select`] ensures that the field order always matches. The `#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::pg::Pg))]` attribute provides a further check that all field types match which what your query is returning. This attribute can improve the error messages generated by the compiler significantly.

</aside>

Let's write the code to actually show us our posts.

::: {.shared-example backends="postgres, sqlite, mysql" }
::: code-block
[src/bin/show_posts.rs](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/$backend/getting_started_step_1/src/bin/show_posts.rs)

```rust
use self::models::*;
use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel_demo::*;

fn main() {
    use self::schema::posts::dsl::*;

    let connection = &mut establish_connection();
    let results = posts
        .filter(published.eq(true))
        .limit(5)
        .select(Post::as_select())
        .load(connection)
        .expect("Error loading posts");

    println!("Displaying {} posts", results.len());
    for post in results {
        println!("{}", post.title);
        println!("-----------\n");
        println!("{}", post.body);
    }
}
```

:::
:::

The use `self::schema::posts::dsl::*` line imports a bunch of aliases so that we can say `posts`
instead of `posts::table`, and `published` instead of `posts::published`. It's useful
when we're only dealing with a single table, but that's not always what we want. It's always important 
to keep imports to `schema::table::dsl::*` inside of the current function to prevent polluting the module 
namespace.

We can run our script with `cargo run --bin show_posts`. Unfortunately, the results
won't be terribly interesting, as we don't actually have any posts in the database.
Still, we've written a decent amount of code, so let's commit.

The full code for the demo at this point can be found here for [PostgreSQL][full code], [SQLite][step 1 sqlite] and [MySQL][step 1 mysql].

[step 1 mysql]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_1

Next, let's write some code to create a new post. We'll want a struct to use for inserting
a new record.

Now let's add a function to save a new post.

When we call [`.get_result`] on an insert or update statement, it automatically adds `RETURNING *`
to the end of the query, and lets us load it into any struct that implements `Queryable`
for the right types. Neat!

<aside class = "aside aside--note">
<header class = "aside__header"> A Note on `RETURNING` clauses</header>

::: aside__text

Not all databases support `RETURNING` clauses. On backends that support the RETURNING clause (such as PostgreSQL and SQLite), we can get data back from our insert as well.
On the SQLite backend, [RETURNING](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_returning.html){target="_blank"} has been supported since version 3.35.0. To enable RETURNING clause add feature flag, `returning_clauses_for_sqlite_3_35` in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
diesel = { version = "2.2.0", features = ["sqlite", "returning_clauses_for_sqlite_3_35"]
```
MySQL does not support RETURNING clauses. To get back all of the inserted rows, we can call `.get_results` instead of `.execute`.
If you follow this guide on a different database system be sure to checkout [the examples specific to your database system](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples){target="_blank"}.

:::

</aside>

Diesel can insert more than one record in a single query. Just pass a `Vec` or slice to [`insert_into`],
and then call [`get_results`] instead of `get_result`. If you don't actually want to do anything
with the row that was just inserted, call [`.execute`] instead. The compiler won't complain
at you, that way. :)

[`.get_result`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/prelude/trait.RunQueryDsl.html#method.get_result
[`.execute`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/prelude/trait.RunQueryDsl.html#method.execute

[`insert_into`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/fn.insert_into.html

Now that we've got everything set up, we can create a little script to write a new post.

::: code-block

[src/bin/write_post.rs](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/$backend/getting_started_step_2/src/bin/write_post.rs)

use std::io::{stdin, Read};

    let mut title = String::new();
    let mut body = String::new();

    println!("What would you like your title to be?");
    stdin().read_line(&mut title).unwrap();
    let title = title.trim_end(); // Remove the trailing newline

    println!("\nOk! Let's write {title} (Press {EOF} when finished)\n",);
    stdin().read_to_string(&mut body).unwrap();

    let post = create_post(connection, title, &body);
    println!("\nSaved draft {title} with id {}", post.id);
}

We can run our new script with `cargo run --bin write_post`. Go ahead and write a blog post.
Get creative! Here was mine:

```
   Compiling diesel_demo v0.1.0 (file:///Users/sean/Documents/Projects/open-source/diesel_demo)
     Running `target/debug/write_post`

What would you like your title to be?
Diesel demo

Ok! Let's write Diesel demo (Press CTRL+D when finished)

You know, a CLI application probably isn't the best interface for a blog demo.
But really I just wanted a semi-simple example, where I could focus on Diesel.
I didn't want to get bogged down in some web framework here.

Saved draft Diesel demo with id 1
```

Unfortunately, running `show_posts` still won't display our new post,
because we saved it as a draft. If we look back to the code in
`show_posts`, we added [`.filter(published.eq(true))`], and we had
`published` default to false in our migration. We need to publish it!
But in order to do that, we'll need to look at how to update an
existing record. First, let's commit. The code for this demo at this
point can be found here for [PostgreSQL][commit-no-2], [SQLite][commit-no-2-sqlite], and [MySQL][commit-no-2-mysql].

[commit-no-2]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/postgres/getting_started_step_2/
[commit-no-2-sqlite]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_2/
[commit-no-2-mysql]: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.2.x/examples/mysql/getting_started_step_2/
[`.filter(published.eq(true))`]: https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/diesel/prelude/trait.QueryDsl.html#method.filter

Now that we've got create and read out of the way, update is actually
relatively simple. Let's jump right into the script:

        .nth(1)
        .expect("publish_post requires a post id")
        .parse::<i32>()
        .expect("Invalid ID");
    let connection = &mut establish_connection();

    let post = diesel::update(posts.find(id))
        .set(published.eq(true))
        .returning(Post::as_returning())
        .get_result(connection)
        .unwrap();
    println!("Published post {}", post.title);
}

That's it! Let's try it out with `cargo run --bin publish_post 1`.

```

Additionally, let's implement a possibility of fetching a single post. We will display the post id with its title.
Notice [`.optional()`] call. This returns `Option<Post>` instead of throwing an error, which we can then use in our matching pattern. For additional methods to modify the constructed select statements refer to the [`documentation` of `QueryDsl`]

We've still only covered three of the four letters of CRUD though. Let's show
how to delete things. Sometimes we write something we really hate, and
we don't have time to look up the ID. So let's delete based on the
title, or even just some words in the title.

::: {.shared-example backends="postgres, sqlite, mysql"}
::: code-block

[src/bin/delete_post.rs](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/$backend/getting_started_step_3/src/bin/delete_post.rs)

```rust
use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel_demo::*;
use std::env::args;

fn main() {
    use self::schema::posts::dsl::*;

    let target = args().nth(1).expect("Expected a target to match against");
    let pattern = format!("%{}%", target);

    let connection = &mut establish_connection();
    let num_deleted = diesel::delete(posts.filter(title.like(pattern)))
        .execute(connection)
        .expect("Error deleting posts");

    println!("Deleted {} posts", num_deleted);
}
```

:::

We can run the script with `cargo run --bin delete_post demo` (at least with the title I chose).
Your output should look something like:

```
   Compiling diesel_demo v0.1.0 (file:///Users/sean/Documents/Projects/open-source/diesel_demo)
     Running `target/debug/delete_post demo`
Deleted 1 posts
```

When we try to run `cargo run --bin show_posts` again, we can see that the post was in fact deleted.
This barely scratches the surface of what you can do with Diesel, but hopefully this tutorial
has given you a good foundation to build off of. We recommend exploring the [API docs] to see more.
The final code for this tutorial can be found here for [PostgreSQL][final], [SQLite][final code sqlite], and [MySQL][final code mysql].
